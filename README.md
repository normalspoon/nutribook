# Description
Nutribook is a web app that allows you to create meal plans. It is special in that it helps you plan your meals to ensure they are nutritionally balanced and complete.

Many people struggle with planning their meals and ensuring they have the right nutrients. Most other apps only track macronutrients and not micronutrients. This could leave us susceptible to deficiencies that could lead to health issues.
